# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 03, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've decided to fork [this repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code) and participate in the [#100DaysOfCode](http://100daysofcode.com/) Challenge. I've been coding here and there for the past 2-3 months from building random templates to working on my personal portfolio but never committed to Github. This will encourage me to keep track of all my work that I do, even if its a small HTML/CSS error :smiley:

Today, I will catch up on all the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) Challenges that I've already done and commit them [here](https://github.com/hermchan/my-freecodecamp).

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to start this journey! Though, I should have done this a long time ago, but better late than never :satisfied:

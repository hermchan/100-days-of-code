# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 03, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've decided to fork [this repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code) and participate in the [#100DaysOfCode](http://100daysofcode.com/) Challenge. I've been coding here and there for the past 2-3 months from building random templates to working on my personal portfolio but never committed to Github. This will encourage me to keep track of all my work that I do, even if its a small HTML/CSS error :smiley:

Today, I will catch up on all the [FreeCodeCamp (FCC)](https://www.freecodecamp.com) Challenges that I've already done and commit them [here](https://github.com/hermchan/my-freecodecamp).

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to start this journey! Though, I should have done this a long time ago, but better late than never :satisfied:

### Day 2: August 04, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've committed all my updated progress on [My FreeCodeCamp Repo](https://github.com/hermchan/my-freecodecamp)

**Thoughts:** Was pretty busy today and only had 1-2 hours of coding, but able to complete 2 FreeCodeCamp Challenges and  pretty happy I was able to keep my FreeCodeCamp github up to date.

### Day 3: August 07, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today, I've worked on FreeCodeCamp's Intermediate Algorithms 09-13 for about 2-3 hours today. I got stuck on [Sum All Fibonacci Number](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/sum-all-odd-fibonacci-numbers) and RegEx majority of the day.

### Day 4: August 08, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from FCC's Intermediate Algorithms today and decided to practice my React. Awhile back, I started a React project for fun, mainly to practice ReactJS and using 3rd party API's (World of Warcraft). I worked on that today and tried to pass information through components.

**Thoughts:** I had trouble figuring out how to pass information through components. Specifically, I had an dropdown menu and I decided to create a new component that would pass the selected option that I would be able to pass to the parent component.

### Day 4: August 09, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing from yesterday, I was finally able to figure out how to save the "selected option" and pass that into the form request to WoW's API to return the characters JSON data. Installed SASS in this project and included webpack and babel.

**Thoughts:** Instead of creating a new component, I decided to keep all the forms together which made it a lot easier to grab the current state. I may end up breaking it into components in the future when I get more familiar with React. Also, I'm happy that I got webpack to work.
